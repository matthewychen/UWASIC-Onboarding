## How it works

The SPI module will sync inputs across clock domains and save them into registers. These registers will be used to control the PWM strength/duty cycle/frequency. The output changes based on the inputted test code; by default, it will be the PWM output.

## How to test

See included test.py.

## External hardware

N/A.
